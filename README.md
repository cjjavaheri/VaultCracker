This project is code for making a Red Blue Cyber Security Exercise.  The code is for a defender and a code breaker for the vault. The red team generates the password to crack the vault. The requirement is that the password generated must be at a local minimum or local maximum of a continuous function. Knowing this, the blue team attempts to guess passwords which may be at the local minimum or maximum. When a guess is made, the blue team sends this guess password to the vault, and then the vault then returns a "score", which is a numric value that the red team assigns to each given password. Once the blue team has successfully guessed the password, the exercise is over and the blue team wins. If the blue team cannot guess the password, then the red team wins.
